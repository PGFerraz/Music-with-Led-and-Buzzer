# Music-with-Led-and-Buzzer
This Arduino program plays "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" using a buzzer and LEDs. Each note lights up a specific LED as the buzzer sounds, creating a synchronized light and sound show. Notes C, D, E, F, G, and A are assigned frequencies and play in sequence with pauses, aligning with the song's rhythm for a simple, engaging effect.
